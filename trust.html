            <p>Our staff operates as a singular unit, ensuring we are doing the best job we can when it comes to the sterilization of everything that comes in contact with or has the potential to come in contact with the world outside the restaurant. At the end of the day, we all go home to our respective families and eat the same products we produce. We treat others how we would like to be treated- especially when it comes to sterilization. If we wouldn’t eat it, you wouldn’t eat it; thats how things are supposed to be.</p>
